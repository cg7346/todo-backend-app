		<h3>Instructions - Todo List</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Within this application a todo task can be created, the user can view all pending tasks, completed tasks, and deleted tasks, they can edit tasks, and permanently deleted tasks. A Task can have the following statuses:
				<ul>
					<li><b>0</b>: pending tasks</li>
					<li><b>1</b>: completed tasks</li>
					<li><b>-1</b>: deleted tasks</li>
				</ul>
				<br>This is done because we do not want to accually delete a task from the database but rather just change the status of the task.
			</p>
			<h4>The todo list contains the following API calls:</h4>
		</blockquote>
		<h4><b>CREATE a Todo task</b></h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>POST /todo</b><br>
				To create a task in the Todo list you need to send a <b>POST</b> request to <b>localhost:8000/todo</b> Within the POST request the body must contain a task as such:<br>
				<b>
					&nbsp &nbsp {<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "task": "My First Todo"<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp }<br>
				</b>
				By default the task will assign an <b>id</b> and <b>status</b> of 0 <b>pending</b>.
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h4><b>GET all pending Todo tasks</b></h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>GET /todo</b><br>
				To get all tasks in the Todo list you need to send a <b>GET</b> request to <a href="http://localhost:8000/todo">localhost:8000/todo</a>. Nothing should be within the body of the request. By default, any new todo created will be shown in this list.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4><b>UPDATE a Todo task</b></h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>PATCH /todo/:id</b><br>
				To update a task in the Todo list you need to send a <b>PATCH</b> request to <b>localhost:8000/todo/<em>:id</em></b>. When sending request you need specify the todo <b>ID</b> in the parameters. For example:<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp <b>localhost:8000/todo/<em>1</em></b><br>

				Within the PATCH request the body must contain a task as such:<br>
				<b>
					&nbsp &nbsp {<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "task": "My First Todo",<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "status": 1<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp }<br>
				</b>
				<em>above is an example of marking a todo as completed</em><br>
				<b>
					&nbsp &nbsp {<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "task": "My First Todo",<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "status": -1<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp }<br>
				</b>
				<em>above is an example of marking a todo as deleted</em><br>

				You can also edit the task name here.
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h4><b>GET all completed Todo tasks</b></h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>GET /todo/completed</b><br>
				To get all tasks in the Todo list that have been completed you need to send a <b>GET</b> request to <a href="http://localhost:8000/todo/completed">localhost:8000/todo/completed</a>. Nothing should be within the body of the request.<br>
				<em>In order to see a todo within this list the todo needs to be created with a <b>POST</b> request. Then edited to be marked as completed with a <b>PATCH</b> request with a <b>status</b> of <b>1</b> in the body of the request. Follow above instructions on how todo so.</em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h4><b>GET all deleted Todo tasks</b></h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>GET /todo/deleted</b><br>
				To get all tasks in the Todo list that have been deleted you need to send a <b>GET</b> request to <a href="http://localhost:8000/todo/deleted">localhost:8000/todo/deleted</a>.<br>

			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h4><b>Permanently delete a Todo task</b></h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>DELETE /todo/:id</b><br>
				There is also the ability to permanently delete a todo task but this should not be used as this would get rid of the task completely from the database. <br>
				This is used only for testing purposes.

				When sending request you need specify the todo <b>ID</b> in the parameters. For example:<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp <b>localhost:8000/todo/<em>1</em></b><br>
			</p>
